Prototype Design Pattern
------------------------

It is a creational design pattern. It is helpful to create different modified objects from the existing object 
of the same class.

Let's say you have an object p1. You can modify the object p1 and create another object p2.

This design pattern is useful when you've an object which are very heavy to create, then prototype comes to 
rescue. You can clone the existing object and modify it.

example
-------

Suppose you want to create object of 2 wheelers and 4 wheelers.
