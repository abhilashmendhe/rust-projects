/*
Singleton
---------
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, 
while providing a global access point to this instance.

Ensure that a class has just a single instance. Why would anyone want to control how many instances 
a class has? The most common reason for this is to control access to some shared resourceâ€”for example, 
a database or a file.
