Strategy Pattern
----------------

This patterns allows to define diffrent sets of algorithm for the diffrent sub-classes and how we can use them 
interchangably.

It enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. Instead of implementing a single algorithm directly, code receives 
runtime instructions as to which in a family of algorithms to use.

examples

first example
--------------

1. Suppose we are creating a Navigation app. This apps helps to find path from source to destination.
2. Now let's say we want to add some features. Like we should get route according to the size of vehicles. Like
it could be Bus, Truck, Car, Bike or even for pedestrian etc.
3. The algo is diffrent for each vehicle type. 
4. There is Strategy required to identify the routes.
5. The app should give route for diffrent types of vehicles in runtime.
6. So we won't be just relying on hard-coded or if-else conditions. We will just define a separate Strategy. 
7. Based on the Strategy defined, the algo will be selected for the vehicle type.


second example
--------------

For mini calculator

1. We have a Strategy interface
