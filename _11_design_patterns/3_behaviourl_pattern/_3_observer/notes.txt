Observer Pattern
-----------------

The observer pattern is a software design pattern that allows an object, usually called the subject, 
to maintain a list of dependents, called observers, and notify them automatically of any state-changes.

first example
--------------

1. Suppose there is a news agency and different channels (channel1, channel2, channel3) as well.
2. News agency are publisher(Observable) and channels are subcribers(observers).
3. If there is a news available, then the news should be broadcasted to all the channels.
4. The job of channels are to ask the news agency if there is any news.
5. In the news agency, we can have a state. So whenever a new news is available, we will go through all the subcribers 
and notify all of them.
6. This observable will have all the observers. If any change in the state/object, it will be notified to all the 
subcribers/obeservers.
